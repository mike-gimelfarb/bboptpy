COllection of Continuous Optimization Algorithms

COCOA is a suite of algorithms in c++ for the optimization of continuous black-box functions (mostly without using derivative information). Main advantages:
- provides a single unified interface for all algorithms
- provides a variety of classical algorithms with state-of-the-art improvements (e.g. automatic parameter adaptation)
- will provide wrappers to other languages (e.g. Python) in the future
